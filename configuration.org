These exist because the emacs byte-compiler cannot be sure
that these variables and functions are actually defined. As
we know that they are, we can tell it to relax!

You should in general never need to care about this
section. We also define a customization group called `elib:'
that can be used for any customizations we create later.

There are some files that it is useful to have a variable
for. If you use some other
- The main directory for emacs configuration files in [[elisp:(find-variable 'user-emacs-config-directory)][`user-emacs-config-directory']]. We do this so we can redefine [[elisp:(find-variable 'user-emacs-directory)][`user-emacs-directory']] later to store random local files in a place which doesn't clutter our configuration directory.
- Location of some extra snippets for the yasnippet package
  from Tuhdo in  [[elisp:(find-variable 'tuhdo-snippets-directory)][`tuhdo-snippets-directory']]. This is used
  later in [[*Yasnippet][Yasnippet]]

- The location of the configuration file (i.e. this file) in
  [[elisp:(find-variable 'config-file-file-name)][`config-file-file-name']] (great name choice right?)
- The location of the scripts file in [[elisp:(find-variable 'scripts-file-file-name)][`scripts-file-file-name']]
- The main directory for my various org files is found in
  [[elisp:(find-variable 'user-org-directory)][`user-org-directory']].
- In [[*Capture][Capture]], we define some ways to capture quick thoughts
  and quotes. I use the two separate files for todo:s and
  quotes, [[elisp:(find-variable 'user-org-quotes-file-name)][`user-org-quotes-file-name']] and
  [[elisp:(find-variable 'user-org-todo-file-name)][`user-org-todo-file-name']]
- Later in [[*Abbrev][Abbrev]] we define some spell-checking tools. We
  have a big file of common spelling oopsies (e.g. owrk
  instead of work). The location of this file is defined in
  [[elisp:(find-variable 'abbrev-location)][`abbrev-location']]
- Folder where all [[elisp:(find-function 'org-gcal)][`org-gcal']]-calendars will be stored in
  [[elisp:(find-variable 'org-gcal-calendar-location)][`org-gcal-calendar-location']] . I use three calendars and
  their individual files have a variable each, all of which
  can be found in `org-gcal-calendar-file-name-list'. These
  settings are used in [[*Calendar][Calendar]]
  - My main calendar in [[elisp:(find-variable 'org-gcal-calendar-main-file-name)][`org-gcal-calendar-main-file-name']]
  - My information committee chairperson calendar in
    [[elisp:(find-variable 'org-gcal-calendar-info-ordf-file-name)][`org-gcal-calendar-info-ordf-file-name']]

:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       6b925028-0d50-4055-b938-2e7c723063f4
:END:
Most programs are installed using emacs package manager and
we do not need to tell it anything about where to find the
lisp-code for the package. Some packages might be installed
by your operating system (in my case, asymptote) or manually
(in my case, mu4e). If you use these packages you might need
to install them specially. I have written a script for
installing these packages which can check out if you want in
[[elisp:(find-variable 'load-path-script-location)][`load-path-script-location']].

The load-paths are defined using the handy little macro
[[elisp:(find-function 'potential-load-paths)][`potential-load-paths']] which takes a list of potential paths
and returns the full file-name of the first one that exists
on the file-system.

The packages and their load-paths are:
- [[*Mu4e][Mu4e]] is an email-reader in emacs. I compile mu4e from
  source and have to add the load-path manually. The
  load-path variable is [[elisp:(find-variable 'elib:mu4e-load-path)][`elib:mu4e-load-path']].
- In [[*Calendar][Calendar]], I use the package [[elisp:(find-variable 'org-gcal)][`org-gcal']] to synchronise
  google calendar with my org-mode calendar files. Sadly,
  there is a bug which prevents you from using more than one
  calendar. There is a solution which someone has tried to
  get into the main package but at the moment it isn't
  there. I therefore use a patched version of the package
  which I have to install manually. The load-path variable
  is [[elisp:(find-variable 'elib:org-gcal-load-path)][`elib:org-gcal-load-path']].
- [[*Rtags][Rtags]] is an incredibly powerful tool for handling code. I
  used to install this manually but since Fedora 28 (I
  think?) there is an operating system which provides
  it. The load-path is defined in [[elisp:(find-variable 'elib:rtags-load-path)][`elib:rtags-load-path']].
- I often use the programming language [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptote_(vector_graphics_language)][Asymptote]] to generate
  vector graphics for graphs. It comes with great
  integration into Emacs and is designed to be used with
  [[*LaTeX/AUCTeX][LaTeX]] and I install it together with the other AUCTeX
  features. I install asymptote through my operating system
  package manager and add the load-path for its lisp-code
  using the variable [[elisp:(find-variable 'elib:asymptote-load-path)][`elib:asymptote-load-path']].

AUCTeX is great but one weird thing about is that it only
allows you to chose one program to use for viewing your pdf:s
you create. I have created a little [[*Helm][Helm]]-program which lets
you switch between viewers.
The function is called [[elisp:(find-function
'elib:helm-tex-choose-program)][`elib:helm-tex-choose-program']]
and in [[*LaTeX/AUCTeX][LaTeX/AUCTeX]] we bind it to "C-c v"
in [[elisp:(find-function 'LaTeX-mode)][`LaTeX-mode']]. I used
this to learn a bit more about the customization features of
emacs so it is definitely more complicated than what is
strictly necessary.


You should not need to modify any of these variables but
feel free to study them and come with suggestions of how to
do it in a more proper way if you like. If you wish to add
some other program as a pdf-reader than the ones listed in
[[elisp:(find-variable 'elib:helm-tex-alist)][`elib:helm-tex-alist']].

You can also customize my settings through the group

We cannot use use-package here because the refile things are defined in the same file as the regular org-functionality. We instead do a hand-made version by telling emacs to run some code either once it loads [[elisp:(find-function 'org-agenda)][`org-agenda']] or, if [[elisp:(find-function 'org-agenda)][`org-agenda']] is already loaded just load it immediately. This is done by the [[elisp:(find-function 'eval-after-load)][`eval-after-load']] functionality of Emacs.

Box 117, 221 00 Lund

The Science Student Union represents about 1800 students
studying at the Faculty of Science at Lund University. The
union works mainly with education monitoring and student
representation but also with aiding students with corporate
relations and hosting social events.

The Information Committee ensures that information from the
union and all its committees, councils and groups reaches as
many members as possible, in the best possible way.

The biggest task of the committee is to distribute the
monthly union newsletter Zenit, that can be read at most
toilets at the departments at the Faculty of Science. The
committee also takes part in the information flow by working
with social media and work delegated by the union board.
