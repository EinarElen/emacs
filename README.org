* About

This is my personal emacs configuration. It is likely full of mistakes and other
disasters but might include something interesting in some places. Everything is
bootstrapped in [[init.el]] and the configuration is in [[configuration.org]].

I am currently trying to make my configuration as portable as reasonable and to be understandable for a beginner to emacs.

I have a file [[file:scripts.org][scripts.org]] where I write some useful scripts such as
- Installing emacs from sources (elisp)
- Installing emacs from your operating system if it (shell)
- Tangling and compiling all files (elisp)
